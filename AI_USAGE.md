# AI-Assisted Development Disclosure

## Purpose

This disclosure explains how AI-assisted tools supported the Product Recommendation System and what remained under human control. It improves transparency without implying that AI tools independently authored, approved, or validated the repository.

## AI-Assisted Tools Used

AI-assisted tools used for selected project tasks include ChatGPT and OpenAI Codex. GitHub Copilot and DeepSeek may also be used in AI-assisted development workflows, but this disclosure does not claim their use unless supported by project records. Development tools include Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, and WSL2/Ubuntu.

Tool use varied by task and development phase. Not every file was AI-generated, and no AI tool independently approved project changes.

## How AI Supported This Project

AI assistance supported selected activities such as:

- Project planning and architecture discussion.
- Codex prompt preparation and task scoping.
- Documentation drafting and editing.
- Code suggestions and debugging support.
- Review assistance and identification of inconsistencies or risks.
- Git/GitHub workflow support.
- Evidence alignment with the Enterprise AI/ML Engineering Framework v2.1.0.

AI assistance was used as decision support. Suggestions were evaluated against repository context, real-data constraints, baseline protocols, tests, and documented project scope.

## Human Review and Responsibility

AI-generated suggestions were reviewed before acceptance. Git diffs, tests, documentation, architecture choices, implementation decisions, and project claims remained under human control.

Final acceptance, commits, publication decisions, and repository claims remain the responsibility of Chathuranga Sudusinghe.

## Git, Testing, and Review Workflow

Accepted changes should be reviewed through:

- `git status` to confirm the intended file scope.
- `git diff` to inspect the exact changes.
- Relevant automated tests when behavior may be affected.
- Documentation review for accuracy, scope, and evidence alignment.
- Small branch-based changes where applicable.

The exact passing test count can change as tests are added. Current test status should be verified with `python -m pytest -q` in the active environment. Test results are repository quality evidence, not certification of production readiness.

## Security, Privacy, and Governance

- Secrets, tokens, API keys, passwords, private credentials, and `.env` files must not be committed.
- Sensitive, private, proprietary, or confidential data must not be intentionally shared with AI tools.
- Raw datasets remain local and ignored by Git where appropriate.
- AI-assisted outputs must be reviewed for security, privacy, copyright, licensing, hallucination, bias, and unsafe recommendations.
- RetailRocket and ABO provenance boundaries must remain explicit; AI suggestions must not invent joins between their identifiers.

## What AI Assistance Does Not Mean

AI assistance does not mean that:

- The project is production deployed or production certified.
- The system is automatically safe, reliable, secure, or correct.
- The lightweight agentic demo is a production autonomous agent.
- MCP-style local helpers are a full MCP server/client implementation.
- CLIP results prove general superiority beyond the bounded proxy sample.
- Human review, testing, security review, governance, or evidence checks can be skipped.

## Known Limitations

AI outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, biased, inconsistent, overconfident, or unsuitable for the repository without human review. AI tools may also miss project-specific constraints, misunderstand evidence, suggest insecure changes, or produce plausible but unsupported claims.

## Current Project Maturity

This project is currently a local, production-oriented, framework-based AI/ML engineering case study. It includes real-data inspection, validation, baselines, CLIP-based multimodal similarity, proxy evaluation, and lightweight local orchestration. It is not a completed production deployment.

## Final Responsibility Statement

Final responsibility for accepted content, code, documentation, commits, repository claims, and publication remains with **Chathuranga Sudusinghe**.
